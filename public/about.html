<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a registered nurse by profession and I originally came from the Philippines where I earned my degree in nursing back in 2010 
  after finishing four years of college. I worked as a registered nurse in a tertiaty hospital for a total of eight years, with a 
  two year hiatus from the nursing profession wherein I worked in a contact center as a customer service representative.</p>
<br />
<p>I arrived in the United Kingdom in the early part of 2020 and became part of the Critical Care Unit of University College 
  Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. I started in a rough time because it was the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and the healtcare 
  service was extremely stretched during thse times. Nevertheless, it taught me the valuable lesson of being resilient.</p>
<br />
<p>At the moment I am learning web development as a means to learn something that is completely new, something that is not related 
  at all to my current career. I enjoy working in front of a computer typing and coding and I realized that I find solace whenever I 
  do. During my spare time, I enjoy playing video games or chess, watching movies or series, reading news or a new book that I find 
  interesting. I am currently living in London with my wife and two lovely kids aged eleven and four.</p>
