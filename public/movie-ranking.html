<h1>The Best Movies According To Randy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
    This is a very well-made gangster movie that was set in the late 40s and teaches about putting family first and abiding by one's own principles
</p>
<br />
<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>
    This is a modern film set in the Wild West and tells a story of Django, a runaway slave from Southern USA that was bought and freed by a dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, Dr. King Schultz, who later on helped Django free his wife, Broomhilda.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>
    The coolest of all science fiction movies that tells about the galaxy's rebellion against an oppresive empire.
